Browser bot for booking NEW times (in Stockholm) for Swedish Passports (Requires that you already have a time). Not intended for commercial use, nor for spamming servers etc.

**Important**
Run: pip install -r requirements.txt

The only values that need updating are; BOOKING_NUMBER, EMAIL and adding the date of your time to current. Consider changing the months that the bot will browse through, stored in dictionary named "months", as the bot is currently only browsing through times in March, to times in July. This will need updating if you are searching for times in, lets say, January.

Ran for a day (3/18) and found a time (3/19) in less than 5 hours. Booking manually could take several weeks at this point in time

*IMPORTANT* No longer works as of updates to the passport booking website
